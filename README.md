# Commercial Management System

Commercial management application developed with Spring Boot and React, designed with a focus on scalability and security using Spring Security and JWT. The system integrates inventory control modules and a credit-based reservation engine, featuring an automated notification system through third-party API integrations (Twilio and Jetmail).
